<p id="description">This project is a GUI-based Image Encryption and Decryption Tool built using Python specifically utilizing Tkinter for the graphical interface and Pillow for image processing. The purpose of this project is to provide an easy-to-use platform for encrypting and decrypting images at the pixel level using a simple encryption technique (similar to a Caesar cipher).</p>

<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Custom Encryption Key Input: Users can input a numeric encryption key to modify pixel values.
*   Drag-and-Drop Image Loading: Load images quickly by dragging them into the GUI window.
*   Image Encryption and Decryption: Perform encryption and decryption on images with a click of a button using the provided encryption key.
*   Save Encrypted and Decrypted Images: Once the image is processed users can save the resulting encrypted or decrypted image.
*   Status Bar: Displays real-time feedback such as success or error messages.

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. Make sure you have Python installed (&gt;= 3.8).</p>

<p>2. Install the required libraries with:</p>

```
pip install pillow
```

<p>3. Clone the repository:</p>

```
git clone https://github.com/deepak-3693/PRODIGY_CS_02.git cd PRODIGY_CS_02
```

<p>4. Run the script</p>

```
python image_encryption.py
```


<h2>üß† Learnings</h2>
<p>This project was built during my internship to explore:</p>

1) Basic cryptographic principles

2) GUI development with Tkinter

3) File handling and pixel-level image processing






  <h2>‚öôÔ∏è How It Works</h2>
The tool manipulates the RGB values of image pixels based on the provided encryption key. Each color channel (Red, Green, and Blue) is shifted by the key value to create an encrypted image. Decryption is simply the reverse operation using the same key.

This project is an educational tool that demonstrates basic image encryption concepts, pixel manipulation, and GUI development using Python.

  
<h2>üíª Built with</h2>
